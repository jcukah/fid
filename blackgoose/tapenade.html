<h1>Tapenade (Olive Spread)</h1>

<p>This is a really simple dish to prepare and it's always a big hit at parties. My father recommends:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Make this the night before so that flowers have time to blend. Just bring it up to room temperature 
before you serve it. In the winter, try serving it warm."</p>
</blockquote>
