<h2>Low and Slow</h2>

posted by BGB, <time datetime="2012-11-15">November 15, 2012</time>

<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking 
technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> 
cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a 
water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks
</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> 
Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us 
before  <time datetime="2012-11-30">November 30</time>.</p>
