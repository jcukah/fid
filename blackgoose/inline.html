<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a <b>new cooking technique called sous vide.</b> In sous vide cooking, you submerge
the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. 
In his book,<cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before, <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30.</time>
